### Play minigolf, but instead  of a club, you directly add force to the ball, remotely, using a weird... loopy... magic controller???? inspired by the window manager Loop for macintosh!
### Will you be able to reach the hole, through deadly traps and teleportation rings (why the hell does our minigolf course got these again???? Isn't minigolf supposed to be a relaxing game????)
#### Controls:
- Click and aim, then release to shoot!
- Press R or double tap to reset the map!
# Happy golfing!
The project used to go by the name "Loop" before I eneded up on the name "Loopy Golf" which is the reason why on hackatime it uses two seperate projects
